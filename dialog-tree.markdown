The diner doesn't appear to have a name. A vinyl banner slung above the door simply reads: "24 Hours." It only has one window, behind which the blinds are tightly closed.
[Try the door.]
    Conway tries the door.
    The door swings open easily. A bell rings nearby. The interior of the diner is pitch black.
    [Walk in.]
        Conway enters the diner and closes the door behind him.
        Someone shines a flashlight in Conway's eyes. The light is almost immediately blinding, but in the instant it switches on he can make out a few figures inside:
    [Wait a moment to adjust to the darkness.]
        Conway stands in the doorway, waiting for his eyes to adjust.
        A bit of errant light from the nearby highway creeps through the front door, and gradually Conway is able to make out a few figures inside:
        ---
        Two old men in trucker hats sit in a corner booth, with a checkers board set on the table between them.
        A young woman standing behind the counter in an apron must be a waitress.
        The cook stares blankly from the kitchen.
        The door slams
        shut and the room is dark again.
        [Sit down at the counter.]
        [Try to open the door and leave.]
